The file appears to have some duplicate sections and missing closing brackets. Here's the corrected version with the duplicated sections removed and proper closing brackets added:

[Previous content remains the same until the Weekly Attendance Chart section]

After the Weekly Attendance Chart section, remove the duplicated content and ensure proper closing brackets are in place. The file should end with:

```typescript
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Overview;
```

The main issues fixed were:

1. Removed duplicated sections that appeared after the Weekly Attendance Chart
2. Added proper closing brackets for the component
3. Ensured proper component export

The rest of the original content remains unchanged. The file now has proper structure and no duplicated sections.
